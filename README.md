# Galaxy metallicity convnet visualization

An exploration of what a trained convnet "sees" when trying to predict metallicity.
This work is based off our model in 
[Wu & Boada 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484.4683W/abstract),
which can be found in 
[another repository](https://github.com/jwuphysics/galaxy-cnns).

Note that this project still makes use of `fastai` version 0.7. Some small adaptions
are required in order to use `fastai` version 1.0, but the updated training
methodology can be found in 
[the demo repo](https://github.com/jwuphysics/convnet-demo/).

Special thanks to the [LSSTC DSFP](https://www.lsstcorporation.org/fellowship_program)!
This project is the fruit of one of the hack sessions.
